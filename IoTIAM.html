        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>
        <p>An emerging issue that has fundamentally affected our IoT usage comes from user identification. Most IoT devices require the identity of the user in 
            order to grant access to their features. For example, our devices use security measures such as entering passwords, pins and patterns. The most 
            influential security measure is through facial recognition. Companies like Apple and Samsung have been implementing this feature with their products 
            for (close to) the past ten years. From an article from Wired, author Julian Chokkattu writes how the incorporation of facial recognition has become 
            the new method for biometrically "unlocking iPhones and authenticating purchases through face scanning" [1]. 
        </p>

        <p>It all comes from those who work behind the scenes. Scientists and engineers are constantly working - around the clock - to achieve a better solution 
            to manage the identity and access of the user from their smart devices. With the rise of AI and machine learning, the technological landscape continues 
            to grow. From the technical standpoint of AI/ML algorithms, it can perform more functions than the system put in place by chatbots, like ChatGPT. Yet, 
            as hackers are becoming more ruthless and cunning with implementing cyber threats, AI/ML needs to be trained to combat these impending attacks. In this 
            report, I will discuss how AI and machine learning plays a role with an IoT's IAM. Moreover, the report will uncover the contributions of both attributes 
            in anomaly detection and as measures to proactively mitigate threats in the ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">AI & Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>AI and machine learning have been revolutionary enhancements in our everyday lives. However, AI and machine learning have distinct operation features. 
            The general definition of AI details as the ability to create new technology can accomplish the features of human beings and beyond [4]. Interestingly, 
            artificial intelligence was established many years ago. According to historical data, around 400 BCE, the idea of AI was thought of as "automatons" that 
            can work without human interaction [4]. Overtime, scientists and engineers began to experiment with AI using newfound technology that was being developed 
            in the 20th century. With the developments of robots and computer machinery, it has created a roadmap for what artificial intelligence could become in 
            the future. 
        </p>

        <p>Here's a video that discusses a breakdown of what AI can do, even with ChatGPT [7].
        </p>

        <h3>Video 1: What is AI? This Is How ChatGPT Works | AI Explained</h3>


        <p>This makes AI different from machine learning. According to an article from Columbia Engineering, it considers machine learning as a "pathway" to 
            artificial intelligence [3]. It further implies that machine learning is about the study involving algorithms that controls how much data is being 
            processed in a computer system. When one reflects on the term "algorithms", it is present in most applications we use. For example, around 2017, 
            instead of the traditional timeline from social media apps - being in chronological order - they began to implement algorithms to sort out the posts 
            that the viewer will see on their timeline [5]. Algorithms would change the way the Internet works and how us, as human beings, react to what we see. 
            Here's a video that talks about the concept behind machine learning and how it's applied in our everyday lives [6].

        <h3>Video 2: What is Machine Learning?</h3>

        <p>Although AI and machine learning serve different fulfillments, both have been used to create the most unique platforms, where the public can ask 
            for solutions to their issues. This has led to the development of AI sources like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, etc. These sources are simple to 
            use so that everyone - young and old - can use their web services. For example, let's take a look at how the ordinary, everyday user works with 
            ChatGPT to solve a complex problem. 
        </p>

        <p>Suppose a user wanted to solve a system of equations from the following two equations below. All it takes is for the user to 
            usually enter a prompt to produce the results in a chronological order. 
        </p>

        <h3>8x+4y=37</h3>
        <h3>3x-5y=63</h3>
        <h3>Equation 1: System of equations</h3>

        <img src="Screenshot 2025-03-07 092759.png" width="600" class="imgMain">
        <img src="Screenshot 2025-03-07 093003.png" width="600" class="imgMain">

        <img src="Screenshot 2025-03-07 093256.png" width="600" class="imgMain">

        <p>As shown from the images above, the developers of ChatGPT made their platform user-friendly, that allows the user to enter 
            a prompt and ChatGPT will send back a response. AI has become so popular, today, that every user from homes, businesses/corporations 
            and even schools. An article, written by John Villasenor, from Scientific American, states how he encourages his students to use 
            ChatGPT to write proficient essays. He further inserts how teachers should teach their students to use it ethically and productively, 
            to drive for enhancement in human creativity in the 21st century [2]. In the general public's perspective, AI is able to detect 
            humans through a biometrical security called facial recognition, as stated earlier. Therefore, the possibilities of AI and ML - becoming 
            a driving change towards IoT security - are endless.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">IoT Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>
        <p>Following up on the previous exploration of IoT security issues, there exists new and emerging threats that place 
            IoT ecosystems in danger.  In the last report, I discussed how standards, the NIST cybersecurity framework and 
            foundation guidelines are shaping the technological landscape of IoT devices. In addition to these essential components 
            that assist with mitigating threats; there's another element that aids with managing 1.) the digital identity of the 
            user and 2.) access control [8]. The IoT Identity and Access Management (IAM) can handle these factors. Kudelski IoThings 
            states that IAM ensures that only authorized users can gain access to IoT networks and devices. Having an effective 
            IAM needs advanced security controls for the purpose of "credibility, integrity and availability of information" [8]. 
        </p>

        <p>Here's a video, from a YouTube channel called IBM Technology, that discusses - in brief details - the concept and application 
            of identity and access management [9].
        </p>

        <iframe class="imgMain" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aNj36g7fSsU?si=qhyAE9CP0webUsDI" title="YouTube video player"

        <h3>Video 3: Identity & Access Management</h3>

        <p>In the next sections, we'll observe how the implementation of AI and ML aims to work, compatibility, with an IoT's IAM.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">How AI and ML Contributes to Anomaly-Based Detection</h2>
        <p>A few chapters ago - specifically Chapter 5: IoT Security Frameworks and Standards - I had made mention of anomaly 
            detection as a type of Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDPS). In summary, anomaly-based detection works 
            to signal the behavior from users, hosts, network connections or applications [11]. In addition, this type of 
            detection can locate unknown attacks, such as malware and prevent its spread from all computer systems. The 
            report from Nile Secure suggests that anomaly detection is better for detecting cyberattacks than signature-based 
            detection, which only gathers signatures from a user. The anomaly detection works to do the following [10]:
        </p>

        <ul id="p2">
            <li>Data collection and preprocessing:</li>
                <ul>Collects data - from network logs, sensor outputs or transactional records - and then cleans 
                    the data to make it easier for analysis
                </ul>
            <li>Feature selection:</li>
                <ul>Distinguishing dataset attributes that are considered from behavior patterns
                </ul>
            <li>Modeling:</li>
                <ul>Process involving the application of machine learning or statistical algorithms to certain features. 
                    Based on an organization's objectives and system requirements to complete this approach
                </ul>
            <li>Anomaly identification:</li>
                <ul>Compares against new incoming data; not all anomalies are indicative of a problem but could 
                    be results of harmless statistical fluctuations
                </ul>
            <li>Post-processing:</li>
                <ul>Anomalies are evaluated and prioritized based on their divergence from normal behavior, potential 
                    impact and the confidence in the detection. Enables organizations to focus their resources effectively
                </ul>
            <li>Interpretation:</li>
                <ul>The final stage where identified anomalies and their rankings are turned into actionable insights. 
                    Some may involve further investigations, corrective actions or even system improvements to prevent future anomalies
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>Although anomaly detection has the ability to call functions to check for overflow, false positives are 
            produced resulting in challenges with signal alert analysis. In addition to this issue, as described in 
            the report from Scarfone et. al, it implies how analysts have had trouble with determining what triggered 
            the alert in the first place [10]. Other issues that surface regarding anomaly-based detection are the 
            handling of large volumes of data; alleviating the complexity of behavioral patterns and applying implementation 
            and fine-tuning, to offer a robust mechanism to carefully identify and address anomalies efficiently [11]. These 
            are drawbacks of anomaly detection when it was first developed. 
        </p>

        <p>Thankfully, we, now, have AI and machine learning that can detect the behaviors of humans and computers. Because 
            of this innovation, scientists and engineers are striving to incorporate these elements into this type of detection. 
            Based on a web article from Nile Secure, AI addresses the complexity of modern network environments [10]. With the 
            major upgrades that are occurring in IoT ecosystems, traditional solutions for detecting threats are becoming 
            outdated. With machine learning, it aims to handle the input from the user and bring out the results to detect 
            structured and/or unstructured patterns and metrics [12]. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">How AI and ML Serves in Proactive Threat Mitigation in IoT Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>In the previous topic, there was a great discussion about how to handle the detection and response of threats. 
            I implied that there are standards, frameworks (specifically the NIST framework) and guidelines established 
            to mitigate threats. There's a strong argument that AI can be utilized for early detection and network risk 
            assessment. In a report by Liu et. al, discusses the upsides for using AI in mitigating network threats and 
            in handling cyber defense. Also, it offers a comparison between traditional and AI-driven threat detection. 
            Below, is a table to express the distinct characteristics of the two threat detection methods [13] and how the 
            authors are convinced that AI is the best route to take.
        </p>

                            <li>Traditional methods struggle to keep up with the volume and complexity of modern network traffic, leading to delays in detecting and responding to threats</li>
                            <li>May generate a high number of alerts, many of which are false positives or benign activities mistaken for threats</li>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Through AI/ML's capabilities, to precisely analyze large amounts of data in a shorter time period, it's 
            highly regarded as the most effective tool to identify attacks everywhere. This prevents the rise of false 
            positives and increases efforts amongst threat response. The role of AI-driven threat detection has become 
            crucial that many organizations deploy AI for their intelligence mechanism, as stated from an article by the 
            National Institute of Standards and Technology [14]. Therefore, AI has shown to become the most effective 
            and powerful source known to man.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Although AI and ML are highly operative, there exist areas of improvement that aim to fix emerging problems. 
            Some noticeable issues and solutions were outlined within the same NIST publication. NIST suggests that the 
            use of AI in IoT threats can give an opportunity for hackers to learn how to manipulate AI/ML systems [14], 
            as with every other system that has been established. The organization recognizes this as a large-scale issue 
            due to the fact that the dependency for collecting/analyzing data falls upon AI/ML tools. Fortunately, there 
            are a couple of solutions for AI/ML to become the most reliable source for handling IAM [14]. 
        </p>

        <p>The first solution pinpoints the idea that a solid defense must have a dynamic and responsive system. Another 
            solution is to standardize data sets to be readily available. This will make the process easier for ML-based 
            solutions to decipher and analyze data. In one's own opinion, these ideas can be accomplished, if implemented 
            the right way. Honestly, it may take a couple of months (even years) for organizations to carefully examine 
            AI/ML systems to catch threats on the spot. In conclusion, by making adjustments to the structure of AI/ML 
            systems, it will provide the most effective strategies towards IoT's IAM.
