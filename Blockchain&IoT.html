        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>

        <p>Each of the previous topics have covered how every element - that functions inside of the IoT device - relies on 
            security. From applying stronger network security to firmware (responsible for connecting the software with hardware 
            in the device), to implementing IDPS systems, IoT network segmentation and firewall configuration, as a means for the 
            establishment of a durable framework. In addition, we have explored how secure boot and trusted execution environments 
            (TEE) ensure trusted software only and data protection. However, there's a new form of technology called blockchain, 
            that has made most of its impact with cryptocurrency. But, now, there are discussions that blockchain may be implemented 
            as a security measure for IoT devices. In this report, the objective is to introduce the concept towards blockchains, and 
            how its mechanisms will achieve secure booting and execution of reliable software.</p>
        
        <h2 id="h2a">Review from Chapter 9: Secure Boot & TEE</h2>

        <p>From my previous report, from Chapter 9, it highlighted characteristics of secure boot and TEEs. Each element has distinct, 
            yet secure methods to make IoT devices more reliable and user-friendly. For example, secure boot ensures devices function 
            through cryptographic signatures and keys. In the case of the UEFI secure boot, one of the most common technological sources, 
            authenticates OS loaders and drivers as an effort to counteract unauthorized mechanisms [4]. Meanwhile, TEEs act on a network 
            and hardware level that can provide separate environments, so that the processed code will not experience harmful attacks. 
            Through the use of secure boot and TEEs, they act as the foundation for how blockchain-based systems operate.</p>

        <h3>Video 1: Blockchain in 7 Minutes | What is Blockchain | Blockchain Explained|How Blockchain Works|Simplilearn</h3>

        <p>Blockchain is considered "one of the major tech stories of the past decade" [1], according to McKinley and Company. It has 
            revolutionized the ability to securely share information, or data, from outside forces that try to break through. As 
            stated before, the application of blockchains has been found through making digital monetary transactions, such as 
            cryptocurrency (like Etherum and Bitcoin). The video, above, provides a great scenario of how blockchains function. 
            Suppose that Person A is able to send money shares to Person B; then, a problem occurs when Persons C and D send their 
            shares to Person B, also. Simplilearn notes that these transactions may fail due to "bank's technical issues; the account 
            being hacked; the limit of transfers made, or high transfer charges" [3]. But with blockchain as a digital ledger, safe 
            encryption algorithms can protect transactions [3], such as holding data in block form [2] with cryptographic protection.</p>

        <h2 id="ol2">[Part 2] What our Future Holds: The Merge between Blockchain & IoT Security</h2>

        <p>One finds the idea that blockchain technology - would merge with IoT - as a fascinating and much needed concept. With 
            blockchain's ability to effectively protect the user's data/transactions, from a general point of view, it is understood 
            that this source can be highly trustworthy. Right now, some of blockchain's applications are used in many sectors, one 
            being healthcare. But, what can the merge between blockchain and IoT mean for the future? Blocktunix, a reputable blockchain 
            development company, specializing in technological fields like AI and virtual reality [6], also have lended their knowledge 
            regarding IoT connecting with blockchain technology. The video, shown below, goes into great detail about the integration 
            of blockchain and IoT [5], and how the merger will impact devices a decade from now.</p>

        <h3>Video 2: Integration of Blockchain with the Internet of Things (IoT) | Blocktunix</h3>

        <p>What makes blockchain different from traditional methods is that it's heavily focused on transparency, security and 
            efficiency [5], as the video above mentioned. According to an article, published by Tripathi et. al, provides a 
            comprehensive review of blockchain technology, highlighting records of its effectiveness and future challenges. The 
            results present the potential work that blockchain technology can achieve and the challenges it takes to obtain a given 
            sector's goals. While blockchain can handle energy consumption and food wastage reduction [2], it involves forming 
            cost-effective strategies to handle other technological issues; this includes: operational costs, the implementation 
            of rules and regulations, data ownership and privacy, etc.</p>
        <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion</h2>

        <p>In conclusion, blockchain technology has proven to become an essential resource in the modern world, and what lies 
            in the future. Although this technology is capable of enhancing IoT data privacy and security, there's still the 
            possibility of the blockchain technology being negatively affected from vulnerabilities. At the end of the report 
            from Tripathi et. al, it details that blockchain should be "carefully chosen" [2], noting the applications and 
            implementations involved with it. One would consider this a valid observation because blockchain and IoT are always 
            evolving. It's crucial that as the development of IoT devices changes over time, so should every element that works to preserve 
            the user's security and privacy. This brings us into the acknowledgement of emerging threats occurring in IoT technology 
            and evolving threats from sources like botnets and AI. (These topics will be discussed in the last two chapters, Chapter 
            11 and 12 respectively). Overall, in this technological age, blockchain technology will greatly impact our communication; 
            which leads to establishing security and accountability.</p>
