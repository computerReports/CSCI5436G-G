        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Thus far, security has been the central theme of our dependency towards technology. The last several reports
             have focused on the idea of IoT devices obtaining greater levels of security from most (or all) angles. 
             Although tech corporations are developing the next generation of security, there's a lingering issue with 
             unauthorized access of personal data. Another element that works collaboratively with security in every IoT 
             device, which is called privacy.  An article, written by Dimitri Shelest, describes privacy protection as 
             the measure to "safeguard one's data and determine what parties can access their information" [10]. When new 
             IoT devices are created and placed on the market, the emphasis of security and privacy is not a strong. The 
             main focus is to ensure that the device is operative for the public to use every feature implemented in their 
             inventions, from smart cars to smart electronics and appliances. Over the past several years, there's been a 
             collaborative force that is striving to investigate security/privacy issues, and how to strengthen their 
             effectiveness. For example, founder and director of Fordham Center for Cybersecurity and professor of Computer Science
             at Fordham University, Dr. Thaier Hayajneh offers his insight [1] on how his team are investigating the numerious problems 
             with IoT security and privacy standards.

        <h3>Video 1: IoT Security and Privacy Issues</h3>

        <p>Many companies, at the time of the IoT device development, were not aware that hackers could manipulate their way through 
            these devices. However, once studies had proven that attackers can hack into IoT devices, just as much as mobile devices, 
            this became a "wake-up call", to say, that changes must be made. Since then, organizations have implemented strategies to 
            combat privacy attacks. Some of the methods that have been implemented - from which will be discussed in this report - are 
            role-based access control (RBAC) and device identity management. The goal of this report is to discuss how these two elements 
            have revolutioned how devices manage data privacy from the user and who can obtain access to their information. We will see 
            the functionality of each element and the areas that it protects, to ensure that user will have the ability to determine how 
            they should have their data shared.

        <h3>Video 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Explained: How It Works and When To Use It</h3>

        <p>RBAC, designed for over 20 years, has become a mechanism established that has been proved to be effective and useful for 
            all forms of technology. The video, above, provides great details of the development of RBAC [2] and the uses of this model 
            in an IoT device. The RBAC model, as mentioned in the video, is made in this order:  
        </p>

        <ul id="p2">
            <li>Managing access starts with having capabilities, for the purpose of controlling data access</li>
            <li>The next level to capability is permissions. Permissions determine who can have access to the information</li>
            <li>Then, the permissions will be granted to a role to access certain orders</li>
            <li>Finally, the user grants the permission based a selected role that an individual or a group is a part of</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="ol2">Usually, the diagram is set up like this:</p>
        <p id="ol2">User --> Role --> Permission --> Capability</p>

        <p>In 1999, John Barkley et. al describes the setup of the RBAC model and its technicalities. For example, the RBAC model 
            was designed as an "alternative to traditional discretionary (DAC) and mandatory access control (MAC)" [4]. Its aim was 
            to provide more security/privacy protection from all users, not just administrators with predetermined rules and organizational 
            roles. In addition, the model was constructed in hopes that exploitable security risks [3] are avoidable. RBAC functions as 
            a relational system where the parent node has the ability to obtain all permissions from the child node [4], based on the hierarchy. 
            Relationships, involving multiple entities, must be organized in the same order as the RBAC model. For example, let's take a look 
            at how relationships work with access control.
        </p>

        <img src="Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 9.20.32 AM.png" width="600" class="imgMain">
        <h3>Figure 1: UML Diagram</h3>

        <p>Figure 1 above, is an image of a UML diagram, from the excerpt from John Barkley et. al, representing a relationship between the 
            physician and the patient [4]. In the context of the RBAC model, the "attending-physician" would be considered the user. This is because 
            the "attending-physician" is capable of granting certain permissions to given roles such as the patient, the attending-physician's 
            assistant and the consulting physician. From there, the permissions will be granted to that role to obtain access to information. As 
            shown, in the case of the patient, they has permission to make known the guardian, legal representative, close family member to a relative 
            and someone to pay for the appointment. 
        </p>

        <p>That's what makes the RBAC model more effective than the DAC and MAC models. However, as privacy protection for IoT becomes 
            complex overtime, there arises the challenge of designing effective access control schemas, to capture "security-relevant" 
            information [6], as stated from Guoping Zhang et. al. In the same report, there have been developments made from other researchers 
            that aim to serve different points of interest. Below is a table that explains additional access models that follow after the 
            RBAC model.
        </p>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Having an RBAC model is crucial for IoT devices to protect the user's data from going directly to an unpermitted 
            location. As highlighted from Singh et. al, IoT integrates newly-developed technologies and existing internet 
            infrastructure [5]. With edge and cloud computing services, it's imperative that enhanced IoT devices have higher 
            performance.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Device Identity Management</h2>
        <p>Along with the RBAC model, device identity management must be issued to every IoT device. From my research chapters 
            2 and 3, I discussed the need for having secure device authentication and authorization. According to an IEEE article from 
            Chen et. al, device identity management is noted as "the process of representing and recognizing entities digital 
            identities in virtual networks" [8]. One would imply that device identity management (IdM) can be added as a component to 
            authenticate and authorize devices, in addition to operable security. As time marches on, the utilization of traditional IdM systems 
            are becoming less as new and innovative tools, like blockchain-based, are utilized inside new IoT devices. </p>
        <p>Blockchain-based 
            secure IoT system works to identify and register IoT devices in a smart grid. This protocol can take a public dataset and 
            recognize devices. A study from Sabrina et. al has shown that the performance of this model proved to have an accuracy rate 
            of over 95% [7]. Having this approach seems to be a viable solution, considering that blockchain-based systems can verify whether
            or not someone's identity is full-proof and secure. But, one believes that some additional tests can be made to ensure that this 
            option can withstand the privacy attacks, which can occur at any given moment.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, as IoT devices continue to evolve, the reoccurring issues regarding the use of devices with networks, such as security and privacy, remains. 
            These "smart gadgets" need privacy protection just as much as having security. In this scenario, one feature cannot work without the other. As shown in this report, the RBAC model and 
            device identity management helps to add the extra layer of security/privacy, for the user to safely use a company's technological product.
            With the new changes that are happening with IoT devices, it is important to have the most secure and compatible methods that aims 
            to safeguard the user's data.
