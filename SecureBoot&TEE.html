        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Since the inception of networks (that are capable of connecting to various forms of technology), IoT devices 
            have impacted how we (the consumers) interact with it. Believe it or not, each of us have some form of IoT device, 
            such as: smart watches, smart TVs, and smart refrigerators. The most common is our smartphones; which can connect 
            us to a given network (home, or on the go like mobile hotspots). These devices have allowed us to complete everyday 
            tasks at ease, compared to four decades ago. However, the rise of IoT devices have also raised concern amongst those 
            who use it on a daily basis. If the device does not have the strongest security  measure, then it becomes more vulnerable. 
            This can open the door for adversaries to successfully enter their way through a user's device and obtain data, unauthorized. 
        </p>

        <p>In my report, from Chapter 3, I discussed how data encryption helps with protecting data from being compromised from 
            unknown users. In addition, an element called "cipher" is used to convert plaintext to ciphertext (from sender to 
            receiver) through a secret key or password. Although data encryption offers a great source of security, this element 
            must be supported through compliances like GDPR and CCPA. In this report, I will discuss, in further detail, about 
            these two compliances and how each one works to ensure that the user's data is private and protected. While ensuring 
            data integrity and confidentiality is maintained, the IoT device's software needs to be assured that it works on a 
            platform that can be trusted. So, I will also focus on secure boots, and how having trusted execution environments 
            (TEEs) aims to make collaborative efforts with the software.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Secure Boot and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)</h2>
        <p>First, let's examine what secure boot and trusted execution environments (or TEEs) are and how they impact IoT devices. 
            According to an article from Fiveable, it regards secure boot and TEE as important components for how a computer system 
            is safely secured. In addition, the article notes how these two elements are 1.) the "foundation of trust" and 2.) 
            providing isolated environments for "verified software" only to run during "case-sensitive operations" [3]. Each element 
            has their unique characteristics. For example, secure boots ensure that essential system boot loaders are provided with 
            cryptographic signatures and secure keys to have the device run functionally whenever "booting" is necessary. The Oracle 
            states how the UEFI secure boot, specifically, works as a "platform firmware" that can authenticate a digitally signed 
            UEFI image, such as an "operating system loader or a UEFI driver". It further explains that "third-party UEFI drivers"
            and "operating system boot loaders" are required to go through the process called BIOS Setup Utility [2]. This system is 
            a requirement for all manufacturers of these devices, such as Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, etc. These companies will uphold 
            different standards; but, it should ensure that the device runs without any faults or missteps.
        </p>

        <p>One would consider TEEs, or trusted execution environments, as an ecosystem. A place where the execution of code contains 
            higher levels of trust, ignoring threats to the central device altogether [1]. Furthermore, TEEs aim to improve the security 
            standards within the "trusted" OS as an act of authenticity to the system itself and a chosen platform [2]. TEEs have a 
            unique architecture that aims to concentrate on having mechanisms and securing the device from all angles, from hardware 
            to network connections. The table, below, describes the TEE's architecture [3]. 
        </p>

        <h3>Table 1: Architecture of Trusted Execution Environment</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Isolation and Protection Mechanisms</th>
                    <th>Hardware-Based Security and Secure Communication</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>TEEs are isolated and focus on securing those designed areas within a processor or 
                        system-on-chip (SoC)
                    </th>
                    <th>Hardware-based isolation and memory protection mechanisms make it extremely difficult for attackers to 
                        directly access or tamper with code and data within the secure environment
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>TEEs, also, have isolated memory regions, such as secure and/or encrypted memory. Based on the environment 
                        selected, it stores the sensitive data and code from the main memory from the system
                    </th>
                    <th>Communication from main operating system and TEE happens through a secure monitor or secure world switch 
                        (channels) for data integrity and confidentiality
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Additional security features: secure storage for cryptographic keys, secure clock and timers, secure 
                        input/output interfaces
                    </th>
                    <th>Provides a set of secure APIs and services allowing trusted applications to interact with the secure environment 
                        & perform sensitive operations
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>One would imply that the architectural outline of this environment is established in a nice and organized fashion; which is 
            why it's needed today. One can tell that TEEs will remain a contributing factor for all IoT devices. Especially with 
            emerging devices that have incorporated the use of AI. Through the use of secure boot and TEEs, the user can be guaranteed, 
            securely, protection against software attacks and data confidentiality and attestation and trust establishment [3].
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">GDPR and CCPA Compliance</h2>
        <p>Now that we have discussed the "frameworks" for ensuring the appropriate secure boot and software methods, in an environment, 
            let's examine how data is handled. As stated before, technology data is the most imperative source that the user has at 
            their disposal. Many unauthorized occurrences - such as data breaches and cyberattacks - have caused many users to raise 
            an eyebrow over this situation. They want to ensure that their information remains private and only given to trusted parties. 
            Because of this, organizations have started to develop data security, including compliance. That's where GDPR and CCPA 
            Compliances come in. Both GDPR and CCPA compliances aid user's data as added layers of protection. However, these compliances 
            function in different ways. First, let's take a look at the regulations that have been established, using GDPR (or General 
            Data Protection Regulation) [8].
        </p>

        <h3>Video 1: Getting started with GDPR compliance: Introduction to the GDPR</h3>

        <p>From the video above, Linda Thielova, DPO of OneTrust, emphasized that GDPR is set up for European Union (EU) users to have 
            "the right to data privacy". In addition, it mentions that the regulation covers 1.) processing activities and 2.) 
            organizations operating within and outside the EU (processing personal data) [8]. Throughout my research into this topic, 
            one has discovered that plenty of sources agree with the mentionings of GDPR from the video. However, other sources have 
            provided much more detail explaining GDPR's inner workings. According to Ben Wolford, the GDPR, effective since May 25th, 
            2018, was passed to deal with security and privacy issues. 
        </p>

        <p>In his report, Wolford highlighted eight points from which the GDPR covers [4]: 
        </p>

        <ul id="p">
            <li>Data protection principles</li>
            <li>Accountability</li>
            <li>Data security</li>
            <li>Data protection by design and by default</li>
            <li>When one is allowed to process data</li>
            <li>Consent</li>
            <li>Data protection officers</li>
            <li>Public's privacy rights</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While these points, from Wolford, are great incentives towards improving the handling of data, another source notes three 
            principles that GDPR must follow. From an article published on Proofpoint, it notes the three principles as follows [7]: 
        </p>

        <ul id="p">
            <li>Transparency: How is the customer's data processed and handled?</li>
            <li>Proportionality: How much of the data would need to be collected?</li>
            <li>Legitimate Purpose: Is there a reason for collecting data?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By implementing these three principles, it gets to the root of the issue with data privacy, and how having consent to obtain 
            such information is essential. This has led to the establishment of GDPR compliance requirements. One of those requirements 
            includes the public's right to switch service locations for their data to remain "intact, protected and private" (shown in 
            Article 20). And another being that data controllers should be in contact with subjects of processing data (shown in Article 15) 
            [7]. A company called Aprecomm, recognized for its service towards building a better network [6], is striving to include SOC 2 
            Certification. The company believes that this will "build upon the company's encryption methods to continue operation at the 
            highest level of data privacy" [5]. Therefore, companies like Aprecomm, visualizes this as an opportunity to further develop a 
            stronger trust for users to store their data from IoT devices.
        </p>

        <iframe class="imgMain" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jc3ltgsUn-k?si=MOSwYWz6rtfmlRdG"

        gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h3>Video 2: What is the CCPA? Where does it apply? How do I comply?</h3>

        <p>CCPA, or California Consumer Privacy Act, works similar to GDPR, in terms of requiring businesses to have a privacy policy [11]. 
            This regulation gives consumers the control over the personal information that businesses collect about them and the CCPA 
            regulations provide guidance on how to implement the law [9]. According to the video above, the channel DPO Advisor explains 
            that CCPA features a "12-month look-back period" for companies to respond to consumer's requests for personal information, 
            in the past 12 months [12]. The CCPA is focused, primarily, on protecting the rights of California consumers. However, it is 
            not subjected to this area alone; CCPA works for organizations in other countries, so long as they abide by the rules.
        </p>

        <p>Some companies had found themselves in trouble for not holding up to CCPA's standards. For example, let's take a look at the issue 
            with Honda's penalty for the user's privacy compliance. In July 2023, Honda, a motor vehicle company, was found responsible for 
            "requiring consumers to undergo an extensive identity verification process, including for requests where verification is not 
            permitted under the CCPA", as recorded from Bickford et. al [10]. With Honda breaking CCPA guidelines, this caused CPPA to get 
            involved with where Honda was wrong in this situation. CPPA, or California Privacy Protection Agency, implied that "Honda's cookie 
            management platform" was the problem. It involved a two-step process where opting out of advertising cookies were available and 
            technologies can be tracked while consenting to cookies. As a result, this led to Honda agreeing to pay $632,500 in monetary 
            penalties and to modify their data privacy practices [10].
        </p>

        <p>Although GDPR and CCPA compliances operate somewhat differently, both will ensure the privacy of consumer's data is respected. Both 
            compliances will impose fines to those who don't follow their rules. Those who violate GDPR laws can face up to tens of millions 
            of euros [4], while those violating CCPA laws will face $25 million (unintended) and $75 million (intended) [12]. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>
        <p>And lastly, the topic I would like to discuss further is personally identifiable information, or PII. This is the source, 
            in which, compliances like GDPR and CCPA aim to protect the user from malicious attacks. According to Vigderman et. al, PII can 
            be described as "any information that can identify or trace an individual either directly (using age, SSNs 
            (social security numbers), email addresses) or when paired with other information (gender, race and birthdate)" [13]. The US 
            Department of Labor agrees with this definition, noting that PII is "information that can be used to distinguish or trace an 
            individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual" 
            [14]. PII has become very influential, in our digital technology, that health departments [15] rely on collecting data from their 
            patients.
        </p>

        <p>As we have seen earlier, companies have access to our PIIs. However, looking at this, from a wider perspective, governments, credit 
            bureaus, and employers have our PIIs as well. It makes sense that businesses and organizations, like these, would have our 
            information. One would infer that this is the reason as to why the concept of a "digital footprint" must be studied by everyone; 
            especially those who have social media accounts. However, as time has progressed, hackers have been very clever in terms of 
            finding ways to maneuver over compliances and obtain the user's PII. Many of those methods include the following [13]: 
        </p>

        <ul id="p">
            <li>Brute force</li>
            <li>Data breaches</li>
            <li>Man-in-the-Middle attacks</li>
            <li>Phishing</li>
            <li>Physical access</li>
            <li>Programming-based hacking, such as exploiting system vulnerabilities to gain administrative privileges</li>
        </ul>

        <p>How can our PIIs be protected from our adversaries? Thankfully, the US Department of Labor inserted a step-by-step process for 
            protection of their employees' PII and other sensitive data. This includes the following [14]:
        </p>

        <ol id="p">
            <li>Responsibility goes to the individual to adhere to the rules of behavior defined in applicable Systems Security plans, DOL 
                and agency guidance</li>
            <li>DOL contractors should respect the confidentiality of information and refrain from careless or negligent conduct. 
                Contractors are to avoid gossip and never permit unauthorized record displays in the DOL system of records (only individuals 
                with a need to know, in their official capacity, are the exception)</li>
            <li>In addition, contractors must obtain a written approval from management before taking any information away from the 
                office. Once granted, the employee must adhere to the security policies</li>
            <li>In the event of theft, contract employees must inform their contract manager ASAP</li>
            <li>If contract manager is not available, they would need to report the theft or loss to DOL CSIRC team through a specified 
                email (on their website)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This example is only provided from a department standard. However, through GDPR and CCPA guidelines, it is guaranteed that our PII 
            is safe from attackers that will do their bidding.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In summary, we looked at how secure boot and trusted execution environments (or TEEs) operate to safeguard user's information 
            from outside forces. As established earlier, an important note to take away is that these elements aim to establish trust and 
            operability amongst verified software. In addition to these features, we examined how the GDPR and CCPA guidelines are put in 
            place to work in the public's interest. And finally, we talked about the information that is highly regarded as PII and how to 
            implement the right steps toward prevention against drastic occurrences. As newer technology, geared towards IoT, comes out into 
            the market, organizations must implement stronger security and privacy regulations. By continuously adapting to new security 
            practices, all of us can look forward to our data being protected from any threat.
