        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>
        <p>With continuous evolution of technology, and its functions, threats have become a central issue amongst the general public. 
            As implied from the report, "IoT Attack Surfaces & Vulnerabilities", IoT devices have a tendency to experience threats if not secured
            in the most effective way possible. 
            With this in mind, there's no denying that threats can occur from our devices at any given moment. These attacks are implemented by 
            the adversary to steal information through IP addresses, URLs or other sources. Because of this phenomenon, organizations, 
            like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), that have specialized in cybersecurity - with certain number of 
            years of research and development - have stepped in to create frameworks to overcome this matter. In the previous report, I discussed how security frameworks are 
            utilized to protect the devices that we work with in our everyday lives. As inferred from IoT frameworks and standards, solving 
            security issues are not a straightforward process. The systems that are set in place deal with challenges involving the Internet
            and direct association with physical objects, as stated from Abdul-Ghani et al. [3]. This report aims to provide further insight with 
            cybersecurity framework, along with additional structures that make these frameworks run effectively in the present and future. We'll
            look into the cybersecurity framework from NIST; the ISO/IEC 27030 framework and the guidelines for creating the foundation, to
            strengthen the IoT's security.
        </p>

        <p>To begin on the subject of threat detection and response, a video is provided below, providing a crash-course. The video is broken down
            into four sections: 1.) continuous process; 2.) vulnerabilities; 3.) understanding tactics and 4.) security. Each section discusses how
            threats are handled step-by-step. This is of a great source that will cover the use of cybersecurity frameworks and guidelines toward
            the rest of the report [7].

        <h3>Video 1: Threat Detection 101</h3>

        <h2 id="h2a">ISO/IEC 27030 Standard</h2>
        <p>ISO/IEC 27030 was a standard that focused on security guidelines for the Internet of Things (IoT). ISO/IEC 27030 falls under 
            the ISO/IEC 27000 family, which is recognized for standards regarding information security management. 
            Each standard in this family works to enable organizations from all sectors and sizes to manage tools such as finances, intellectual
            property, employee data and entrusted third party information [8]. Details of the family standard are provided from ISO's website;
            however, ISO/IEC 27030 is no longer on the website. The closest code that was featured on ISO's website was ISO/IEC 27031. 
            ISO/IEC 27031 focuses on the guidelines for planning, implementation and operation for business
            continuity readiness [9]. According to another website, it is stated that ISO/IEC 27030 was moved to Committee Draft
            in 2019 [10]. 
        </p>

        <p>Although there are not enough sources discussing how the ISO/IEC 27030 standard works, there have been some clues and hints of what the 
            draft covers. From one source, the standard covers the principle behind IoT and smart cities [11]; while another source from Cesare Gallotti,
            a consultant in information security from LinkedIn, stated how ISO/IEC 27030 was set as a guideline on "risks, principles and controls
            for security and privacy controls for IoT" [12]. To summarize, this standard was drafted to set rules for regulating security and privacy management within IoT 
            devices. So far, it's been almost 6 years since the standard was drafted; possibly, one believes that other standards would enact upon the 
            same features as ISO/IEC 27030. Although this standard was not finalized, there is a framework that aims to pursue security guidelines 
            for IoT devices; which is the NIST IoT Cybersecurity Framework, designed by the National Institute of Standard and Technology.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">NIST IoT Cybersecurity Framework</h2>
        <p>The NIST IoT cybersecurity framework has been utilized for many home and on-the-go devices. The goal of this
            framework is not to remove the activities that are working well. However, it (NIST framework) aims to complement 
            the ongoing efforts while working on new areas of focus. According to an article, written by Meg Scotfield, there 
            are three sections that the NIST cybersecurity framework works to achieve [2]. Details, regarding to each tier and code, 
            are found from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 handbook under appendices A and B [5], which is assessible 
            to the general public. Those three sections include the following:
        </p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>NIST's Areas of Focus</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Core</th>
                    <th>The core of the NIST framework involves five basic functions for prioritizing resources and
                         promoting cybersecurity awareness. Those five functions are: identification; protection; detection;
                         response and recover. From the NIST document, it mentions that there are, actually, six functions, the
                         additional function being govern. Each has their duties to accomplish the subcategories within
                         the function [5].
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Implementation Tiers</th>
                    <th>Through the implementation tiers, it doesn't show levels of maturity. Yet, it does discuss the
                        range of risk management practices and provides context for the way organizations view cybersecurity risks [5].
                         There are four tiers that plays a critical role in this element: partial; risk-informed; repeatable and adaptive.
                         <ul>
                            <li>Tier 1: Partial</li>
                            <p id="p2">The application and prioritization of the cybersecurity risk strategy is managed in an ad hoc manner
                                and is not based on any objectives or environmental threats. The issue, at this tier, is that there's a limit
                                to the awareness of cybersecurity risks on the organization level. Usually, the organization will run the risk
                                management through irregular, case-by-case basis. Furthermore, because it does not have the capabilities to process
                                cybersecurity information, it involves more time and effort to detect the risks involved with the supplier and their
                                products and services.
                            </p>
                            <li>Tier 2: Risk-Informed</li>
                            <p id="p2">Although this form is not established for organization-wide policy, management can approve risk management practices.
                                And, unlike Tier 1, the prioritization of activities and protection comes from organizational risk objectives or 
                                business requirements. In this tier, awareness of risks are noted on the organizational level; however, not on a larger
                                scale. As a result, this tier does not consistently execute the necessary response.
                            </p>
                            <li>Tier 3: Repeatable</li>
                            <p id="p2">Tier 3 notes that the risk management practice are approved as policy; in addition, these practices are regularly
                                checked and updated according to the application process. Cybersecurity information is regularly shared through the
                                organization; methods can respond effectively to changes allowing personnel to gain the knowledge and skills to fulfill
                                their job roles.
                            </p>
                            <li>Tier 4: Adaptive</li>
                            <p id="p2">This tier expresses that an organization-wide approach has been achieved to manage these risks and proceed to
                                determine how to address potential events in the future. Organizations use real-time or near real-time information to act
                                upon the risks associated with the suppliers and their products and services. Not only is the information shared throughout
                                the organization, but also to authorized third parties. 
                            </p>
                         </ul>
                     </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Profile</th>
                    <th>Organizations work to set goals and objectives through the self-assessment of two states: "As-Is" 
                        and the desired "To-Be". As inserted from Ren Cahoon, executive consultant of Reynolds Cahoon LLC, stated how "If an
                        organization is implementing best practices all around, parts cannot fit better in an organization as it would if
                        the work was done in a warehouse with tons of parts". He added, "It's a question of deciding what are the essential
                        practices that optimizes and tunes the organization to its highest performance" [2].
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The three elements described above represent how beneficial it is to use the NIST framework. One benefit is the capability
            of the framework to navigate through the difficult requirements and operational landscape. It makes understanding the inner-workings,
            to detect and response to any threat, much easier. Another benefit comes from the framework's adaptability throughout a range of
            businesses and fields. According to Bruce deGrazia, collegiate professor that works closely in cybersecurity, suggests that applying
            the NIST framework will "become the 'de facto' industry standard" [2]. Overall, applying this structure can go a long way towards
            handling advanced threats and how to respond expeditiously.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">IoT Security Foundation Guidelines</h2>
        <p>With these factors in mind, handling threat detection and response can be executed on its own. It needs a support structure for cybersecurity
            risk management (CRM) systems to remain stable for an extended period of time. The solution involves having foundation guidelines to ensure that 
            security methods are legitimate for IoT devices to run securely. According to Mukhadin Beschokov, the author of the IoT Security
            Foundation guide from Wallarm, describes how this structure "aims to spread enough awareness about IoT security that related risks
            are in control, detected earlier and damages are on the lower side ... supports best practices and promotes the adoption of the IoT
            security assurance framework" [6].  
        </p>

        <p>With the primary goal of the IoT security foundation being to strengthen the security ecosystem, it requires the best practices to
            achieve the desired outcomes. In the same reference, Beschokov offers some key IoT security recommendations. One recommendation would
            be to have a robust management governance, which involves a well-trained professional to handle data privacy and product security [6]. 
            A highly skilled personnel, from an organization, must know the In's and Out's of implementing the essential strategies of building the IoT's 
            security reputation. Another recommendation is to provide enough attention to network applications and frameworks [6]. Often at times, when security
            is implemented into IoT devices, only applications are considered. However, the framework should consider all angles; from software applications
            to network-based apps and interfaces.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While the development for advanced IoT security measures are continous, this calls for improvements with
            handling threats effectively. In this report, it was revealed how foundation guidelines and frameworks - for IoT Security - 
            are on the mission to detect and respond to threats as soon as it happens (without any delays). One must imply that the process of 
            developing frameworks and rules, to establish better safety protocols, seem time-consuming. Although this may seem true, organizations 
            and business/corporations are working to find better methods of implementation. Below, is a video from Trend Micro, a cybersecurity 
            software company, that discusses what can make threat detection and response more effective not only for the present, but for the 
            future [4].

        <h3>Video 2: What is needed for effective threat detection and response</h3>

        <p>Now that artifical intelligence (AI) is in our midst, this could lend a hand to solving emerging threats. AI-driven threat detection 
            works to address the limitations once found from traditional detection methods. This is done by leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning models 
            to analyze vast amounts of data and identify anomalies at a high accuracy rate. AI, being the source for machine-learning 
            algorithms can quickly sort out abnormal patterns, unauthorized access or other indicators of potential threats [1]. AI threat detection 
            is not limited to these features alone; it perform other tasks also. Some other features
            that can be achieved through AI threat detection include: the ability to adapt to new and existing attack techniques; the ability to perform real-time 
            data processing and analyzing; and can work in conjunction with IDS, 
            firewalls, and security information and event management (SIEM) to provide a comprehensive defense strategy [1]. (In a future report, I will
            discuss how implementing AI-driven threat detection like this can combat against threats.) In conclusion, these guidelines and principles 
            are set to find and eliminate threats on the spot, providing a piece of mind to users that work with IoT devices daily.
