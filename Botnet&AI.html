        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>

        <p>The IoT's ecosystem, overtime, has been transformed to make its landscape larger than it was about 2 or 3 decades ago. 
            Although we, now, are given options to personalize our own settings and features, this technology still faces problems. 
            As the technological landscape increases, so can security risks. Whether we want to believe it or not, threats are 
            continuing to grow at an alarming rate. As previously mentioned, malicious attackers are constantly learning the 
            infrastructure of IoT technology, and how to maneuver into the user's system and steal their personal data. How can 
            these evolving threats be prevented? The aim is to continue the discussion from the previous topic, surrounding the 
            emerging threats from IoT technology. This report focuses on some evolving threats that are found from botnets and 
            artificial intelligence (AI). We will see how botnets and AI are transforming the scale of cyberattacks worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Video 1: The Botnet Attack: How They Hack Your Devices!</h3>
            
            <p>Botnets are becoming dangerous amongst vulnerable IoT technology. There are a couple of explanations of what botnets do 
                to an IoT system. A generic description describes the computer network where unprotected devices are controlled through 
                malicious attacks, such as malware [1]. Specifically, it involves a situation where the adversary is positioned to control 
                the user's device, and perform sketchy tasks, like theft, spam, DDoS attacks and spying [3]. In the video above, it goes 
                into further detail about tactful ways hackers can breach a user's device. Methods like phishing and botmasters attacking 
                targets through nodes, to go to command-and-control mechanisms [7], shows how serious adversaries want our sensitive 
                information (to be sold on the dark web). This should raise an enormous level of concern amongst consumers that purchase and 
                utilize these devices everyday.</p>
            
            <p>Through the strength of these botnets, it's turning IoTs into IoVs, or internet of vehicles. Some experts, who have studied IoT 
                botnets, have found that Mirai has become the most predominant DDoS IoT botnet, with a record breaking 1.1Tbps DDoS attacks [3], 
                which comes from compromised IoT devices [1]. But, why is this large-scale occurrence happening? A report, written by Kishore 
                Angrishi, published in 2017 states that botnets are due to the ignorance of manufacturers, to update security measures during 
                the device's life cycle [2]. One finds that the need to push new IoT devices to the market, without ensuring devices are 
                protected, is concerning. However, if the realization that botnets were the only thing that posed a threat to our data, we were 
                mistaken. Even malicious actors are manipulating through Ai's infrastructure also. The next video, below, features SkillPath 
                trainer, Philip Wiest, on his thoughts about Ai-driven threats [6].</p>

            <h3>Video 2: AI-Driven Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
            
            <p>Nowadays, AI and ML are used everywhere, from home, school, work, etc. We have online resources that derive from these features, 
                like ChatGPT. AI and ML are used in virtual reality (VR) headsets that are capable of creating an avatar that looks almost 
                identical to the user. With the help of these tools, data processing has become faster and cost-effective. In addition, AI 
                and ML can detect any abnormalities that occur. But, what happens if the Ai source on the IoT device is not protected? What 
                happens now that the adversaries can trick their way through IoT devices using AI? This results in more mishandling of data 
                and makes detection practices more inaccurate and useless.</p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Solutions for Incoming IoT Technologies</h2>

        <p>However, there are ways to ensure that problems, regarding botnets and AI-driven attacks, will not spread rapidly. Cybersecurity 
            specialists are, heavily, relying upon AI for anomaly-based detection, as discussed from the Chapter 7 report. This adoption has 
            been implemented for the internet-of-energy-things (IoET) and internet-of-medical-things (IoMT). Alrubayyi et. al suggests that 
            Ai can successfully detect stress, with 96% accuracy and detect the malware's behavior from an artificial immune system (or AIS) 
            [5]. Furthermore, a report on Security Threats and AI based countermeasures showed that most ML-based countermeasures/solutions 
            showed no presence of challenges [4]. Improving the quality of AI's detection, overtime, as upcoming IoT products are released, 
            will block the advancement of our adversaries.</p>
                
        <p>One would argue that it isn't a total loss for handling botnets either. According to an article published in 2018, from Prokofiev 
            et. al provides a method for detecting IoT botnets; which is the logistic regression model. It is a statistics-based strategy that 
            determines the events that the device was a part of an IoT botnet at as initial connection [1]. Although this model comes from a 
            mathematical approach, it has been proven to detect botnets at the propagation stage. Another research proposal, from Hamza et. al, 
            has demonstrated that there are several detection methods that could function as ways to detect botnets. This includes clustering, 
            neural network and recurrent neural network. There are some issues with the clustering method. First, it involves test datasets to 
            be in "clusters" of "sufficient data points",  and it does not provide a real-time analysis [3]. Other methods either depends on 
            human brain-like structure or sequential information to execute the same amount of work for each element in a sequence.</p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion (Final Thoughts)</h2>
        <p>As changes in IoT technology are underway, it's imperative that this growing innovation obtains the best security & privacy measures 
            it deserves. As shown here, with the rise of AI and botnets, they can cause more harm than helping the problem at hand. As the 
            responsibility falls on manufacturers and companies to launch new IoT devices, ensuring security & privacy features are enacted 
            upon, to react to the threats at hand, it is also our job [as consumers] to be more inquisitive and not provide sensitive information 
            (to vulnerable devices). This series of reports served to highlight several key aspects of the many dangers found from IoT devices, 
            and what can be done to render every part of the technology usable. </p>
