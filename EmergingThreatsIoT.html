        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>

        <p>IoT technology has made an enormous contribution to how we live, work, and communicate with others [3] in the digital world. 
            The point can be addressed that its architecture, functions and features have made our (the people's) job easier and 
            faster than the workload we managed over two decades ago. However, this poses a major concern amongst us, as the consumers. 
            The heavy reliance upon IoT technologies - in public and private sectors - has its advantages and disadvantages. Whereas 
            IoT technology can perform real-data analysis that can obtain results in a matter of minutes, there remain security 
            and privacy concerns that are addressed from the general public.</p> 

        <p>One feels that these series of reports have uncovered details, regarding each element that plays a crucial role in IoT. From 
            topics ranging from IoT attack surface areas, to the use of blockchain (as an option for IoT security), one implies that 
            IoT devices cannot function without these features. However, because of the advancements in networks, the new developments 
            of this technology and its environment, IoT requires additional measures to combat the new attacks in future products, to 
            protect the public and industry interests. For this report, the aim is to directly focus on the potential emerging threats and what 
            can be done to meet security and privacy needs.</p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Emerging Threats Found in IoT Technologies</h2>

        <p>As found from previous reports, much of the emerging threats in IoT technologies largely affect businesses and corporations. 
            As more and more industries switch data, from a traditional workflow to the cloud, they're placing employees and corporations' 
            reputations at risk. One believes that if an IoT technology contains many flaws - such as vulnerable web services; lack of 
            legal, regulatory and rights; buffer overflows and storage issues [4] - it is time to take immediate action, for the safety 
            and security in the workplace. All it takes is for these vulnerabilities for an adversary (or even a group of adversaries) 
            to implement strategic efforts to either tamper with data, or easily pass through secure data authentication. As reported from 
            Device Authority, with vulnerable web applications and software, public and private sectors are at risk of malicious firmware 
            attacks and their personal information being stolen [3].</p>

        <h3>Video 1: Common IoT Cyber Attacks Explained: Technical</h3>
            
        <p>The video, above, explains some of the common IoT cyber attacks that have been reported. This includes DDoS and phishing attacks 
            that come from weak networks and passwords [6]. A key cyberattack that the video mentioned was evolving threats that come from 
            botnets, which resulted in internet outages from servers. This affects areas across the Internet like social media sites and 
            government-owned webpages. (More discussion on the threats from botnets will be discussed in further detail in the last 
            chapter.) Although protecting IoT networks is important, other portions of the technology must also become tightly secured. It's 
            worth noting that IoT consists of 5 distinct layers: sensing, network, middleware, gateway and application. The table below lists 
            the security issues from these layers, as provided by Sahu et. al [1]. </p>

        <p>With the recognition of attacks, from all layers, organizations have to be more vigilant toward these vulnerabilities. Overtime, 
            several solutions have been made to advance IoT security and protect the user's wellbeing. Those solutions include 
            blockchain-based, fog computing-based (enabling faster data processing and reduced latency), machine learning-based and edge 
            computing-based solutions (reducing data exposure and curbs communication expenses for cost efficiency) [1]. Overall, handling 
            security threats must involve a sense of clarity.</p>
            
        <p>Stacey Higginbotham, an industry analyst that works closely with IoT products and services, provides a great explanation about 
            the problems with security in the digital space. She states that: "The lack of clarity around what makes a connected device 
            secure has big impacts beyond adding a lot of extra tests for some nebulous certification. It also means that engineers building 
            connected products don't have a playbook to work from. With IoT devices being so complex, the lack of some kind of standard 
            checklist leads to security vulnerabilities" [2]. One would view this argument as an important element that comes with IoT 
            technology. In addition, one would imply that dedicated research and development and transparency must occur to ensure that 
            the trust across all sectors is accepted.</p>

            <h2 id="h2a">How Can IoT be Better Protected from New & Emerging Cyberattacks?</h2>

            <p>Despite adversaries' ability to strategize scheming ways to gather digital information, the continuous innovation for 
                stronger IoT security is being developed by organizations and businesses. In order to achieve this goal, IoT security, 
                according to Kaspersky, has to begin at the "smart" home. IoT technologies have to be developed to overcome 
                vulnerabilities like insecure default settings, obsolete components, and insecure update mechanisms [3]. But now, with 
                the introduction to artificial intelligence and development of stronger ransomware, it raises more technological 
                concerns. The video, below, provides details about these potential emerging threats to pay close attention to. 
                Furthermore, it provides examples, from the past, to support their evidence.</p>

            <h3>Video 2: Emerging Cyber Threats to Watch Out For</h3>
            
            <p>These threats include ransomware (RaaS), IoT vulnerabilities, and harmful artificial intelligence mechanisms that quickly 
                adapt to the device [5]. However, Congress has stepped in to implement two regulations that protects users using IoT 
                devices. This includes the IoT Cybersecurity Improvements Act and Smart IoT Act. The IoT Cybersecurity Improvements Act 
                has been described in the report that, in the event that a device sold to the US government, must use a mechanism to 
                "patch devices" [3] to protect sensitive information. The Smart IoT Act involves the Department of Commerce to "conduct analysis and provide suggestions" to IoT industries 
                about "secure expansion" [3] of the products. This demonstrates the gravity of how IoT threats are handled and what needs 
                to be accomplished. Because, after all, what would be the reason for using a vulnerable IoT device? Everyone, from 
                Congress and organizations, to manufacturers and users, must play a part to limit the cyberattack's exposure.</p>

            
                <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>To conclude this topic, one must recall that IoT has become a major upgrade in the field of technology. It continues 
                    to be the driving force that revolutionizes how homes, schools and businesses are operated. IoT has become so popular 
                    that it has made its mark across corporations that specialize in the field of automation. However, as the times 
                    change, so will the architectural framework of IoT devices. Because of the adversary's growing knowledge to 
                    manipulate this system, organizations and manufacturers have to enforce new security and privacy standards, and 
                    uphold those practices before issuing their product to the world. It goes without saying that cyberthreats must be 
                    managed so that the user can fulfill their everyday duties, knowing their devices are protected at all times.</p>
