        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Since we have used the internet to execute our daily activities -- from our devices -- the 
            potential chances of online data being at the adversary's dispoal has increased over the years. 
            Over the last two chapters, I have explained how security measures, such as device authentication,
            are needed to be set while using IoT devices. However, it's not only the device that should be
            protected; but the submission of data into different areas needs layer of protection also. The best
            example to describe this scenario is when we communicate through email.
        </p>

            <p>Figure (a). Email from the 1990s</p>
            <p>Figure (b). Email in the present day</p>
        </div>

        <p>Email has been the source of online communication since the late 1980s (became more popular around the 
            late 1990s to early 2000s). This includes AOL, Microsoft Mail (in 1988), Apple's AppleTalk Networks, and 
            many more [5]. Figures (a) and (b) illustrate the page of a composed email message from the 1990s and
            from the present. It has greatly affected the way we can talk to each other; receive notifications from 
            companies that we had subscribed to and send information, whether it is in document form or audio/video form. 
            At the time that email started to become the emerging portion of technology, there grew concerns about hackers 
            attempting to intercept emails during transmission over public networks. Security protocols needed to be 
            established so that the sender can direct their messages with private information to the receiver, without it 
            being read by the adversary. The protocol that would be developed to safely and securely send data through online 
            communication would be from data encryption.
        </p>

        <p>Data encryption is a reliable solution for protecting data from our devices from being stolen or compromised by malicious
            attackers. It is one of the crucial elements for secure communication protocols to work efficiently for data transmission. 
            The process of data encryption involves a plaintext being transformed into a code using an algorithm called a cipher. 
            The ciphertext is, then, set to be readable by those with a secret key or password [4]. The receiver
            obtaining the given secret key can decrypt the data back into its original file form [6]. Data encryption comes 
            in two distinct forms: symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption. Both types ensure that data can be encrypted and 
            decrypted as secure as possible; the only difference is that symmetric uses one secret key while asymmetric uses a pair of
            public and private keys [7]. Looking from a security, flexible and authentication perspective, the asymmetric 
            encryption is the most preferred choice. Applications, email communications and online bank transactions use asymmetric 
            encryption because it's more secure and does not require sharing a single secret key [3]. 
        </p>

        <p>Below, is a short video of how data encryption works and how it is resourceful for transmitting information through
            public and/or private networks [9].

        <p id="h2a">Video 1: Encryption & Public Keys</p>

        <p>Secure communication can be viewed as a process of sending and receiving information in a secure manner, protecting it from 
            unauthorized access. Secure communication involves the use of encryption and other security mechanisms to ensure that the 
            user's data is securely transferred between two or more parties. It, also, uses encryption algorithms to scramble data in
            transmission, making it difficult for adversaries to read the information as it is being sent over the network connection.
            This involves confidential information such as passwords, credit card numbers, personal and other documents. These sources of
            information need to be protected, at all times, while transmitting through public networks (internet or wireless) [4]. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Secure Device Authentication (continued)</h2>
        <p>Encryption and authentication work collaboratively to develop a strategy for a multi-layered defense. Encryption
            encodes the data that does not give unauthorized users access to read
            what is found. In this case, encryption acts as the first line of defense; while authentication acts as a secondary
            layer. The inner workings of authentication can be envisioned as someone who is the controller of encrypted data. 
            Utilizing the authentication tool can quickly determine who can and cannot have access to that data. By having this
            dual-layered approach, the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access is significantly reduced. 
        </p>

        <p>Last week, I discussed how important secure device authentication is and how it has been influential as the quality of IoT
            devices become advanced over time. Authentication can come in various forms: for example, some companies use security key
            fobs or cards for the employee to gain access to their accounts to perform day-to-day tasks. Meanwhile, general places like
            schools and homes use mobile apps to authenticate the device that is logging into an account. In addition, I demonstrated the
            use of a multi-factor authentication source called DUO mobile, as a security measure for students to safely log into their
            Georgia Southern portal. (See chapter 2: Secure Device Authentication for more details.)
        </p>

        <p>Having device authentication measures are very resourceful to prevent malicious attackers from taking advantage. There
            are many methods that apply to this standard. These methods of device authentication have advantages and disadvantages; 
            which will be highlighted for the purpose of robust security. There's a source of device authentication that does not 
            involve the usual password entry; it is regarded as highly favored amongst companies and industries. That source is called 
            biometric authentication; which one implies that this could be used towards the adversary's advantage. A detailed account
            of my concerns of this type of authentication will be mentioned in the upcoming sections of this report. With data encryption 
            supporting compliance, there are industry regulations put in place to protect sensitive data; for example, General Data Protection 
            Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As revealed in later chapters, these 
            regulations are utilized as trusted executable environments for the purposes of handling personal identifiable information.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Methods of Secure Device Authentication</h2>
        <p>According to the article from Ahmet Polat, the author lists the best practices for how security can be made stronger than 
            ever before [2]. Each of the four methods have their own features that limits the risk of data breaches and reduces the 
            possibility of malware on the device that can disrupt operations.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">I. Password-Based Secure Authentication</p>
        <p>With advanced authentication techniques making its way into different forms of technology today,
            the password-based method seems to be the most widely used methods upon users. This method involves
            the user entering in a distinct combination of characters (that is manageable to memorize) to verify their
            identity to gain access.
        </p>

        <p id="p1">II. Multi-Factor Authentication</p>
        <p>Multi-Factor Authentication, or MFA, is considered a higher security level than the password-based
            authentication. This source requires users to complete two or more pieces of evidence, to prove that
            the device is verified to continue further into the system. These factors fall into three categories
            depending on what category was utilized from various businesses. The three categories are the following:
        </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><img src="Password.jpg" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="column"><img src="SafeID-Enterprise-Front.png" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="column"><img src="Fingerprint.jpg" width="100%"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">1. Something one knows (password or PIN)</h4></div>
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">2. Something one has (smartphone or security token)</h4></div>
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">3. Something one is (fingerprint or facial recognition)</h4></div>
        </div>

        <p id="p1">III. Biometric Authentication</p>
        <p>Biometric Authentication is one of the newer versions of secure authentication. Biometric authentication 
            relies on some unique characteristics (concrete or practical) to verify a user's identity. Common biometric 
            methods include:
        </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><img src="Fingerprint.jpg" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="column"><img src="Facial recognition.jpg" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="column"><img src="Voice recognition.jpeg" width="100%"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">1. Fingerprint scanning</h4></div>
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">2. Facial recognition</h4></div>
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">3. Voice recognition</h4></div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="iris scanning.jpeg">
            <img src="Biometrics.jpeg">
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>4. Iris Scanning</p>
            <p>5. Behavioral biometrics (typing patterns, gait analysis)</p>
        </div>

        <p id="p1">IV. Token-Based Authentication</p>
        <p>Token-based authenticatioin involved the use of a physical or digital token to verify a user's identity.
            This method can take various forms:
        </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><img src="SafeID-Enterprise-Front.png" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="column"><img src="Softwaretoken.png" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="column"><img src="JSONwebtoken.png" width="100%"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">1. Hardware Tokens (USB keys, Smart cards)</h4></div>
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">2. Software Tokens (Mobile apps generating time-based one-time passwords)</h4></div>
            <div class="column"><h4 id="p">3. JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for web applications</h4></div>
        </div>

        <p>These authentication tools are unique and equip to keep data secure; however, the authentication suggestion that one feels 
            worried for is the biometric authentication. Having the ability to detect someone's fingerprint, voice, face and typing patterns is
            concerning. Based on an article from Cursor Insight, Akos Molnar describes how machine learning algorithms can analyze patterns 
            towards the user's behavior. This includes analyzing the data of someone's handwritten style; a person's 
            speech pattern and an individual's face [1]. Although studies have shown that biometric authentication is an effective tool, 
            one feels skeptical about its effectiveness for detecting the user. For example, with facial recognition, the adversary can come up with 
            sneaky and crafty tactics of cloning the user (to trick the device into believing them). In addition, one implies that figuring
            out a person's typing patterns seems to be an interesting procedure, yet a challenging task to fulfill. How could an authentication tool 
            tell the typing patterns of each individual that is using the computer at a given moment? Because of these reasons, one believes that this 
            method is risky and should be securely equipped, first, where it is safe for the public to use.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The utilization of secure authentication and encryption develops a wide-scaled security frameset. Implementing
            these practices ensure that there's a higher level of protection while the user sends an email and makes online
            transactions. One feels that as time progresses, the technology that we utilize will change and newer strategies
            will need to be prioritized. This is where industry regulations -- like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and 
            Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) -- would need to update their legal framework to fit the needs
            of the advanced features of futuristic electronics. These regulations are in charge of setting the necessary requirements
            to meet health and safety codes [8]. In future reports, one will discuss in more detail about how industry 
            standards are implemented with companies specializing in technology, even secure authentication tools. Overall,
            these secure authentication tools are capable of preventing security threats that occur everyday.
