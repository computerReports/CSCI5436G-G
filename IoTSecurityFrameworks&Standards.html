        <h2 id="h2a">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Security is the most important component in the modern digital world. It has been the foundation for 
            all devices since the advancements in technology began to flourish. Around the 1990s, the idea of using
             virtual private networks (or VPNs) and cybersecurity software became the central focus once the masses
              had internet access. When the public was able to communicate through the internet - for instance, to 
              send email to another individual or a party - there was a growing concern of cyberattacks such as 
              man-in-the-middle attacks and denial of service (DoS) attacks. These are only some of the concerns that 
              many people have through network connections while using IoT devices. In the last report titled "Network 
              Security for IoT", I pinpointed how firmware vulnerabilities can impact the use of IoT devices, if security 
              measures are not taken consistently. 
        </p>

        <p>Inside IoT devices, firmware serves as the center of everything, such as ensuring the hardware works well with
             the software in devices. Looking from a futuristic perspective, as advancements towards technology continue to
              flourish, more people will utilize them causing more dangerous threats to ensue. To have stronger and productive
               IoT security frameworks and standards, there are three elements that should be carefully studied. The IoT network 
               segmentation; firewall configuration and intrusion detection/prevention systems can illustrate how frameworks and 
               standards are applied. In this report, the objective is to discuss further details about the security framework for 
               IoT devices, and address the standards that have been established in order for the structure to remain stable overtime. 
               At the end of this report, the reader will have a better understanding of IoT security frameworks and standards work 
               collaboratively.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">IoT Network Segmentation</h2>
        <p>Since the early 21st century, IoT devices have included the capability to connect a list of devices onto the internet. 
            Occasionally, there are situations where IoT devices would need to go through a process of network configuration. 
            This means that settings, controls and policies are established to support the communication between devices and systems 
            [7]. This measure is applied whenever the device is new to a network either from home or from another source. There are 
            four distinct configurations that involve networks; this includes router, host, and software configurations and permissions. 
            Each configuration aims to set up the proper controls, flow operation and security settings to work efficiently through 
            internet networks [7]. 
        </p>

        <p>IoT frameworks, alone, cannot solve the issues towards potentially malicious network traffic. Studies have shown that vulnerable 
            devices and weak infrastructures are becoming easier targets for types of malicious attacks. This includes third party threats 
            such as ransomware and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks [11]. For keeping individual devices within their IP boundaries, 
            network segmentation aims to ease the traffic by dividing the lines of networks into subsections [6]. The IoT network segmentation 
            is structured to work with security frameworks to solve some fundamental problems. Some of the problems that IoT network 
            segmentation aims to address are the following [11]:
        </p>

        <ul id="p">
            <li>Client isolation for new and existing IoTs that are potentially harmful in the Local Area Network (LAN)</li>
            <li>Enforces and controls outbound traffic so that adversaries are unable to use IoT to attack remote parties</li>
            <li>Control of trusted cloud and remote services, interacting with IoT, are increasing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The video, that is presented below, explains about network segmentation and how it works well in organizations. 
            Also, this video dives into how network segmentation works alongside zero-trust policy, to ensure that those, who do 
            not secure access to the network, cannot go any further [4].

        <h3>Video 1: What is Network Segmentation?</h3>

        <p>Having security frameworks is important because it suits the needs of the public and private sectors. Many industries 
            rely on network-like industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) segmentation to improve the IoT environment. Recently, there's 
            a report written by computer scientists and engineers, who have worked closely with network segmentation across connected 
            IIoT devices. 
        </p>

        <p>First, their research has shown that IIoT segmentation is a division of local area networks (LANs) and virtual local area 
            networks (VLANs). These two networks provide a gateway to 1.) reinforce the general security posture and 2.) to be capable of 
            each segment being independently monitored and managed [10]. With the critical role of technology in the workplace, IIoT 
            segmentation has been applied in most or nearly all companies. The practical use of IIoT segmentation effectively can ensure 
            that owners of companies can protect their employees from severe damages like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. 
            This report uncovers the advantages and disadvantages of IIoT segmentation. Some advantages include [10]:
        </p>

        <ul id="p">
            <li>Segmentation can restrict devices and their data movement, reducing the chances of any unauthorized access</li>
            <li>Makes management and securing a wide array of IIoT devices much easier</li>
            <li>Reduces latency and enhances the network performance by the way of controlling traffic and access</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although IIoT segmentation can produce better security results for networks, it does not come without some downsides. 
            Some of the downsides that come with implementing IIoT segmentation security are the following [10]: 
        </p>

        <ul id="p">
            <li>Using IIoT segmentation, with such a large array of networks, can become complex and may require more resources</li>
            <li>Operational cost will increase due to additional hardware, software and management effort</li>
            <li>Due to the variety of IIoT devices and systems involved, it raises challenges for already existing security standards 
                to be integrated into the IIoT environments</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From these viewpoints, it's important that future IIoT environments are developed to meet the criteria for better network 
            performance and management. And furthermore, IIoT environments should come with less equipment and better compatibility and 
            array handling features. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Firewall Configuration</h2>
        <p>Firewall has been a concept for IoT security frameworks since the evolution of technology took into shape. Firewalls are used 
            for the purpose of protecting the user's device from unauthorized users to gain digital access. An exemplary principle of 
            firewalls is the structure of a brick wall - strong, stable and difficult to easily pass through. But, as with other computer 
            systems, firewalls need network security also, due to the rise of data leakage and cyberattacks making organizations more 
            vulnerable than ever before [8]. Unprotected firewalls can lead to adversaries prying their way through the device gaining 
            control and producing malware. Thus, is the reason for why proper firewall configuration must be enacted upon. 
        </p>

        <p>The following video below describes the fundamental elements of firewalls. We'll see how its structure is used to safeguard 
            devices by granting or denying permissions from sources such as: IP addresses; domain names; protocols; programs; 
            ports and keywords [3]. 
        </p>

        <iframe class="imgMain" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kDEX1HXybrU?si=ADRfpi2F_trEmVm1" 
        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
        picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h3>Video 2: What is Firewall?</h3>

        <p>The structural firewall operates the same functions as network firewalls. As explained from the video, network firewalls 
            work with the administrator assigning permissions for which networks can enter and exit [4]. However, with network firewalls, 
            the access that comes wirelessly - or from routers - are limited between two security domains and monitors that are logged to 
            establish connection [5]. Network firewalls can be divided into multiple domains; but, it would involve more demilitarized zones - 
            such as email, virtual private network and web servers - that needs management [9]. This can become an issue, overtime, as 
            cyberattackers are getting clever to break through firewalls. Thankfully, there are appropriate actions that can be taken to 
            secure network firewalls from potential hacks and breaches. Some of these actions include the following [9]:
        </p>

        <ul id="p">
            <li>Update firewalls with the latest firmware </li>
            <li>Delete, disable, or rename default accounts and change default passwords</li>
            <li>Use unique and secure passwords for accounts created</li>
            <li>Never use shared user accounts because additional admin accounts will have limited privileges from individual responsibilities</li>
            <li>Restrict outgoing and incoming network traffic for certain applications or transmission control protocol or TCP</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With a well configured firewall, there's an enhancement in security; improved network monitoring and regulatory compliance, 
            that assists an organization comply with data protection regulations [8]. It is additionally noted that penetration testing 
            and vulnerability scanning are great resources for testing firewall configuration. Ensuring that there's the right amount 
            of traffic, for networks to safely connect to other devices, means that the firewall configuration is efficient. With these 
            tests, in case of the test resulting in a failure, a back-up setting can be applied to maintain its [the firewall's] integrity.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems</h2>
        <p>Through the making of security frameworks, systems are needed to ensure that IoT devices are protected from adversaries. The system, 
            in which a computer system or network is analyzed to find signs of possible threats and vulnerabilities is called intrusion 
            detection/prevention systems or (IDPS). IDPS is a joint system of intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system 
            (IPS). IDS and IPS works similarly to automate the detection process; however, IPS can also make attempts to prevent incidents from 
            being severe. IDPS is used among technologies to perform and detect methodologies [1]. There are several different methods for IDPS 
            detection: signature-based, anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis. The National Institute of Statistics and Technology 
            provided, in detail, how IDPS detection methods and technologies function, to suit the needs for security frameworks. Each of these 
            methods are viable sources for detecting errors.
        </p>

                    <th>The signature-based detection method refers to a system input (also referred to as network traffic) processing 
                        certain behavioral patterns such as a person's signature. Signature-based detection works to pick apart possible 
                        signatures that are found to be fraudulent [2]. Because this method is simplistic and has little understanding of 
                        network/application protocols, it is deemed useless for detecting attacks from a number of angles.</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Anomaly-Based</th>
                    <th>The anomaly-based detection is a method that is more effective than the signature-based detection. Anomaly-based 
                        detection calls functions like monitoring system calls of a process to check for overflow. Moreover, this detection 
                        method utilizes profiles to detect behavior from users, hosts, network connections or applications [2]. The disadvantage 
                        of this detection is the production of false positives (or false alarms) from the activity in certain profiles. 
                        Because of this flawed feature, it makes analyzing the signal of the alert challenging. </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Stateful Protocol Analysis</th>
                    <th>With a stateful protocol analysis, the IDPS can detect the state of network, transport and application 
                        protocols. What sets this method apart from anomaly detection involves a process that compares vendor-developed 
                        universal profiles [2]. (These profiles are responsible for mentioning the structure of HTTP requests and 
                        responses.) Stateful protocol analysis determines which protocols are prohibited and which ones are accessible. 
                        However, due to the requirement of more resources to make this method effective, performing an analysis would be 
                        difficult to achieve and tracking numerous sessions could cause an overhead [5].</th>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>There are a selection of IDPS technologies involving network-based, wireless, network behavior analysis (NBA), and host-based scenarios. Although there are 
            limitations of the technology, each option functions to secure protocols. For example, Wireless IDPS has the ability to detect attacks and misconfigurations 
            at the wireless local-area-network (WLAN) protocol examining IEEE 802.11 protocol [2]. (The IEEE 802.11 protocol communication involves a wireless endpoint 
            device and an access point). However, it cannot examine high level communication like IP addresses; generally, it would involve a network-based IDPS to address 
            an analysis of higher-level communications. Having various forms of IDPS detection and technologies are resourceful for testing the effectiveness of protecting 
            IoT systems.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h2a">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As revealed in this report, network segmentation, firewalls, and IDPS work together to ensure the safety and security of IoT 
            devices across networks. Each element - for developing stronger security frameworks and standards - involves extensive 
            research and testing, which may result in a time-consuming process. But, finding the right tools, based on the architectural 
            outline of certain IoT devices, can ensure safer frameworks to have better network security. Without structure and protocols, 
            one believes that IoT devices will not survive the potential vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. With new developments, shaping 
            the technological landscape, means industries must increase security protocols and regulations.
